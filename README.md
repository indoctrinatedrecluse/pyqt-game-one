## PyGame - collision game

* The idea here is to make a collision game where there is a ball and the player will have a paddle to hit the ball. The ball will bounce off the paddle and the walls.
* The player will have to move the paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from hitting the bottom of the screen. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life.
* The player will have 3 lives to play the game. If the player loses all 3 lives, the game is over. The player will have to press the space bar to start the game.
* The player can use the arrow keys to control paddle movement.
